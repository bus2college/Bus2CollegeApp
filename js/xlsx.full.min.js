/*
  Local placeholder for SheetJS (xlsx) library.

  NOTE: This is a lightweight placeholder so the app can reference a local
  file instead of the cloudflare CDN. It does NOT implement SheetJS features.

  To use the real SheetJS library, download the official `xlsx.full.min.js`
  build from https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs and replace this file with it.

  Minimal behavior: if code calls `XLSX`, this placeholder creates a stub that
  throws a clear error so you know to replace it with the real library.
